# weather-dashboard

Steps

1.  Create a wireframe on what the page will look like
2.  Get api key at openwheather.org and study api documentation - note we will need a icon of the weather. 
3. First try to connect to the api and get the current temp, humidity and wind speed and the 5 day forecast for these same variables for a static city - like San Francisco. Lets use FETCH  or the AJAX JS command. 
3. Use boot strap for the components of the webpage and the layout. 
4. make sure links to jquery and script file is made



GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
